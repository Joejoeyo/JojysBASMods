# Welcome to my BAS mod repository. 
### I've decided to release the source code to all of my current code mods for anyone interested in learning or porting to Nomad.
## Disclaimer, I am by no means a good programmer, this is all barely functioning, and you'll see a lot of failed attempts and commented out methods in the source.
## Disclamer 2, I will not be porting any of these to Nomad myself. I don't own Nomad, and as much as I love WarpFrog and BAS, I don't want to buy an inferior version just to port my mods.
This is also because I've grown tired of countless "nomad when?" questions on not just my own mods, but literally every single mod that doesn't immediately have Nomad support. I understand it sucks to be left out, but these are my reasons.

## All of these mods are licensed under GNU GPL 3.0, which means you can use, modify, and share the code in any way you want.
### the only caveat is that if you share it, you must also license it with GPLv3
